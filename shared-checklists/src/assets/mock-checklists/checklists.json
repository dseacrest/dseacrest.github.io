Push yourself to read faster, 2. Read only key words. 3. Use a pacer, 4. Hum a tune to yourself or chew gum, 5. Push tongue to the top of your mouth.\nConcentration: Ability to focus on single task.  Trait of highly successful people.\nRead Distractors: Things such as tv, phone, email, music (except Mozart), kids, location, that distract you from focusing. \nNote Making Tools: Pen or pencil to help you mark keywords or areas that include important text.  Remember 20% of text includes 80% of important words.  \nBackground Knowledge: Knowing even a little about the subject helps you learn a lot more.  Spend time researching the subject before you read about it.  \nPhrasing: Reading a group of words that form a thought.  AKA thought grouping.\nColumn Width: Wider column text takes longer to read because your eye needs to travel farther in each direction to group phrases.\nRead Between Lines: Focus on the white space between the lines and not on the words themselves.\nIndenting: Focus on words an inch inwards on each side of the margins.

Skip: Scanning is looking for something specific in a text.  Skimming is reading the keywords of the text to get the gist of all the material and to see if there is anything you should read in detail.
