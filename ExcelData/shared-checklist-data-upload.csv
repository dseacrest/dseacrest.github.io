For example, we're more likely to work late if others in our team are doing the same, put a tip in a jar if it already contains money, or eat in a restaurant if it's busy.

Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,762,Ward’s method,"In this method all possible pairs of clusters are combined and the sum of the squared distances within each cluster is calculated. This is then summed over all clusters. The combination that gives the lowest sum of squares is chosen. This method tends to produce clusters of approximately equal size, which is not always desirable. It is also quite sensitive to outliers. Despite this, it is one of the most popular methods, along with the average linkage method."
Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,763,Curse of Different Variable Type,"If variables are measured on different scales, variables with large values contribute more to the distance measure than variables with small values.  Need to standardize data."
Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,764,Types of Clustering,"Hierarchical, K-Means, Two-Step.  If you have a large data file (even 1,000 cases is large for clustering) or a mixture of continuous and categorical variables, you should use the SPSS two-step procedure. If you have a small data set and want to easily examine solutions with increasing numbers of clusters, you may want to use hierarchical clustering. If you know how many clusters you want and you have a moderately sized data set, you can use k-means clustering."
Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,765,Cluster v. Discriminant Analysis,"Although both cluster analysis and discriminant analysis classify objects (or cases) into categories, discriminant analysis requires you to know group membership for the cases used to derive the classification rule. The goal of cluster analysis is to identify the actual groups."
Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,766,Hierarchical Clustering,"Agglomerative methods, in which subjects start in their own separate cluster. The two ’closest’ (most similar) clusters are then combined and this is done repeatedly until all subjects are in one cluster. At the end, the optimum number of clusters is then chosen out of all cluster solutions.  Divisive methods, in which all subjects start in the same cluster and the above strategy is applied in reverse until every subject is in a separate cluster. Agglomerative methods are used more often than divisive methods, so this handout will concentrate on the former rather than the latter."
Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,767,Outliers,"K-means clustering is very sensitive to outliers, since they will usually be selected as initial cluster centers. This will result in outliers forming clusters with small numbers of cases. Before you start a cluster analysis, screen the data for outliers and remove them from the initial analysis."

Clustering Checklist,Clustering Checklist,,771,Irrelevant Variables,Cluster analysis has no mechanism for differentiating between relevant and irrelevant variables.  Therefore the choice of variables included in a cluster analysis must be underpinned by conceptual considerations. This is very important because the clusters formed can be very dependent on the variables included.

Hypotheses Checklist,Hypotheses Checklist,,3310,Testable Criteria,"To create a ""testable"" hypothesis make sure you have done all of these things"
Hypotheses Checklist,Hypotheses Checklist,,3311,Testable,"Make sure your hypothesis is ""testable."" To prove or disprove your hypothesis, you need to be able to do an experiment and take measurements or make observations to see how two things (your variables) are related. You should also be able to repeat your experiment over and over again, if necessary.  (Ex   The measure for success that we can test is will users use the program longer.)"
Hypotheses Checklist,Hypotheses Checklist,,3312,Clear,Make it clear. A good hypothesis is written in clear and simple language. Reading your hypothesis should tell a teacher or judge exactly what you thought was going to happen when you started your project. (Ex  People of any age learning to code will prefer that the background color of each webpage will be white).

Hypotheses Checklist,Hypotheses Checklist,,3316,Predictions,"If I do ______, then ______.  Predictions should include both an independent variable (the factor you change in an experiment) and a dependent variable (the factor you observe or measure in an experiment). A single hypothesis can lead to multiple predictions, but generally, one or two predictions is enough. (Ex   If I change the background color to white (independent variable), then users will use the program for an average of 5 minutes longer (dependent variable)."
Hypotheses Checklist,Hypotheses Checklist,,3317,Conclusion,"At the end of your testing you should be able to say that the data either  1.) invalidates your hypothesis or 2.) does not clearly invalidate your hypothesis.  You should avoid saying that it proves your hypothesis.  The reason for this is that you are usually working with a sample of the population and are not testing the entire population.  For example, if your hypothesis is that all swans are white.  If you survey 10 swans and they are all white, you cannot prove that all swans are white.  However, if you survey 10 swans and 1 is black you can disprove that all swans are white.  Our goal is not to prove the ultimate truth but to try to avoid false truths.  "

Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4114,Influence of Stress (Including Breaking Points),"Stress causes both mental and physiological responses and tends to amplify the other biases. Almost all human mental biases become worse in the face of stress as the body goes into a fight-or-flight response, relying purely on instinct without the emergency brake of Daniel Kahneman’s “System 2” type of reasoning. Stress causes hasty decisions, immediacy, and a fallback to habit, thus giving rise to the elite soldiers’ motto  “In the thick of battle, you will not rise to the level of your expectations, but fall to the level of your training.”"
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4115,Relativity,"Relativity has been used in several contexts in the world of physics, but the important aspect to study is the idea that an observer cannot truly understand a system of which he himself is a part. For example, a man inside an airplane does not feel like he is experiencing movement, but an outside observer can see that movement is occurring. This form of relativity tends to affect social systems in a similar way."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4116,Seeing the Front,"One of the most valuable military tactics is the habit of “personally seeing the front” before making decisions – not always relying on advisors, maps, and reports, all of which can be either faulty or biased. The Map/Territory model illustrates the problem with not seeing the front, as does the incentive model. Leaders of any organization can generally benefit from seeing the front, as not only does it provide firsthand information, but it also tends to improve the quality of secondhand information."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4117,Niches,"Most organisms find a niche  a method of competing and behaving for survival. Usually, a species will select a niche for which it is best adapted. The danger arises when multiple species begin competing for the same niche, which can cause an extinction – there can be only so many species doing the same thing before limited resources give out"
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4118,Via Negativa – Omission/Removal/Avoidance of Harm,"In many systems, improvement is at best, or at times only, a result of removing bad elements rather than of adding good elements. This is a credo built into the modern medical profession  First, do no harm. Similarly, if one has a group of children behaving badly, removal of the instigator is often much more effective than any form of punishment meted out to the whole group."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4119,Second-Order Thinking,"In all human systems and most complex systems, the second layer of effects often dwarfs the first layer, yet often goes unconsidered. Once one person does it, everyone will do it in order to see, thus negating the first tiptoer. Now, however, the whole parade audience suffers on their toes rather than standing firmly on their whole feet."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4120,Arbitrage,"Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other. This model is simple on its face, but can present itself in disguised forms  The only gas station in a 50-mile radius is also an arbitrage as it can buy gasoline and sell it at the desired profit (temporarily) without interference. Nearly all arbitrage situations eventually disappear as they are discovered and exploited."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4121,Deducing the Complex,Complex information is best digested in the form of narratives and analogies. Many thought experiments make use of this fact to make them more accessible.
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4122,Inertia,"An object in motion with a certain vector wants to continue moving in that direction unless acted upon. This is a fundamental physical principle of motion; however, individuals, systems, and organizations display the same effect. It allows them to minimize the use of energy, but can cause them to be destroyed or eroded."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4123,Black Swan,"Also popularized by Nassim Taleb, a Black Swan is a rare and highly consequential event that is invisible to a given observer ahead of time. It is a result of applied epistemology  If you have seen only white swans, you cannot categorically state that there are no black swans, but the inverse is not true  seeing one black swan is enough for you to state that there are black swans. Black Swan events are necessarily unpredictable to the observer (as Taleb likes to say, Thanksgiving is a Black Swan for the turkey, not the butcher) and thus must be dealt with by addressing the fragility-robustness-antifragility spectrum rather than through better methods of prediction."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4124,Network Effects,"A network tends to become more valuable as nodes are added to the network  this is known as the network effect. An easy example is contrasting the development of the electricity system and the telephone system. If only one house has electricity, its inhabitants have gained immense value, but if only one house has a telephone, its inhabitants have gained nothing of use. Only with additional telephones does the phone network gain value. This network effect is widespread in the modern world and creates immense value for organizations and customers alike."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4125,Tragedy of the Commons,"A concept introduced by the economist and ecologist Garrett Hardin, the Tragedy of the Commons states that in a system where a common resource is shared, with no individual responsible for the wellbeing of the resource, it will tend to be depleted over time. The Tragedy is reducible to incentives  Unless people collaborate, each individual derives more personal benefit than the cost that he or she incurs, and therefore depletes the resource for fear of missing out."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4126,Confirmation Bias,"What a man wishes, they believe.  Use hypothesis testing, blind testing, and scripted validations to uproot bias."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4127,Irreducibility,"We find that in most systems there are irreducible quantitative properties, such as complexity, minimums, time, and length. Below the irreducible level, the desired result simply does not occur. One cannot get several women pregnant to reduce the amount of time needed to have one child, and one cannot reduce a successfully built automobile to a single part. These results are, to a defined point, irreducible."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4128,Inversion,Try problem solving by thinking in reverse or deciding what you want to avoid rather than what you want to gain.
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4129,The Map Is Not the Territory,The map of reality is not reality itself. This model tells us that there will always be an imperfect relationship between reality and the models we use to represent and understand it.
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4130,Randomness,"Much of the world is composed of random, non-sequential, non-ordered events. We are “fooled” by random effects when we attribute causality to things that are actually outside of our control. If we don’t course-correct for this fooled-by-randomness effect – our faulty sense of pattern-seeking – we will tend to see things as being more predictable than they are and act accordingly."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4131,Bias from Incentives,"Highly responsive to incentives, humans have perhaps the most varied and hardest to understand set of incentives in the animal kingdom. This causes us to distort our thinking when it is in our own interest to do so. A wonderful example is a salesman truly believing that his product will improve the lives of its users. It’s not merely convenient that he sells the product; the fact of his selling the product causes a very real bias in his own thinking."
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4132,Circle of Competence,"Each individual has an area where they truly know their stuff.  When making decisions, define and attend to your special circle.  Outside that circle you may be ignorant of your own ignorance.  "
Mental Models Checklist,Mental Models Checklist,,4133,"The three major psychological findings that fall under Representativeness, also defined by Kahneman and his partner Tversky, are","a. Failure to Account for Base Rates, An unconscious failure to look at past odds in determining current or future behavior. b. Tendency to Stereotype, The tendency to broadly generalize and categorize rather than look for specific nuance. Like availability, this is generally a necessary trait for energy-saving in the brain.  c. Failure to See False Conjunctions, Most famously demonstrated by the Linda Test, the same two psychologists showed that students chose more vividly described individuals as more likely to fit into a predefined category than individuals with broader, more inclusive, but less vivid descriptions, even if the vivid example was a mere subset of the more inclusive set."

Myths of Entrepreneurship,Myths of Entrepreneurship,,4179,8.      I SHOULDN’T TELL ANYONE ABOUT MY IDEA OR THEY WILL STEAL IT,"Not always true.

Your idea should be evolving so if someone tries to steal it, you will already be working on a better version."
Myths of Entrepreneurship,Myths of Entrepreneurship,,4180,"7.      IF YOUR IDEA IS GOOD, YOU’LL BE SUCCESSFUL","Not always true.

Myths of Entrepreneurship,Myths of Entrepreneurship,,4181,11.  YOU MUST HAVE A LOT OF RELEVANT EXPERIENCE TO BE A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR,"Not always true.

Myths of Entrepreneurship,Myths of Entrepreneurship,,4184,6.      YOUR FIRST IDEA BETTER BE GREAT,"Not always true.  Most successful companies started with a different idea than what they are currently doing.  3M started as a mining company, Abercrombie & Fitch a sporting goods store, Avon a Bookseller, Microsoft a traffic data system software, Nokia a paper mill, Hasbro Toys a textile remnants company.  If you want to be successful, just start selling something you are passionate about.  Figure out what people are buying and pivot to their needs."

Once issue number 1 is solved, then go to Issue number 2. Once you get through the first three Issues, then reprioritize the next three most important issues.

You should have no more than seven main leadership functions (such as marketing, sales, operations, customer service, it, HR, finance, etc.).

Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,,5804,Release to Manufacturing (RTM) ,"The term ""release to manufacturing"", also known as ""going gold"", is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered. This build may be digitally signed, allowing the end user to verify the integrity and authenticity of the software purchase. A copy of the RTM build known as the ""gold master"" or GM is sent for mass duplication if applicable. RTM precedes general availability (GA), when the product is released to the public.  It is typically used in certain retail mass-production software contexts—as opposed to a specialized software production or project in a commercial or government production and distribution."
Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,,5805,Alpha ,"The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing.  In this phase, developers generally test the software using white-box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black-box or gray-box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release.  Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.  The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze.  At this time, the software is said to be feature complete."

Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs, as well as speed/performance issues and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating acceptance and usability testing. This is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization or trusted advisors that developed it. Some developers refer to this stage as a preview, preview release, prototype, technical preview / technology preview (TP), or early access."
Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,,5808,Release to web (RTW),Release to web (RTW) or web release is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution.

Private beta could be suitable for the software that is capable to deliver value, but is not ready to be used by everyone either due to scaling issues, lack of documentation or still missing vital features. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version."
Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,,5815,Acceptance Testing,Acceptance Testing is a level of the software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery.
Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,Software Release Life Cycle Checklist,,5816,Release,"A release candidate (RC), also known as ""going silver"", is a beta version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs. A release is called code complete when the development team agrees that no entirely new source code will be added to this release. There could still be source code changes to fix defects, changes to documentation and data files, and peripheral code for test cases or utilities."

Afterward have each department write down the three issues that were most serious and most frequently occurring.  Combine all the departments issues and prioritize the most commonly marked issues.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6480,Better Wrong Than Vague,"Early stage validation is one of the only times where being wrong should be encouraged.  Being wrong means, you saved yourself the time and money of pursing an idea or version of your idea that would have failed.  Being wrong means, you can pivot to a better idea or better version of your idea quicker than the competition.  "
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6481,Two Magic Questions,"Always start every conversation with one of two magic question  1.) what do you think is the biggest problem with _(insert subject)_, and 2.) why, why, why?"
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6482,Usability Testing Other Solutions,You should usability test other people’s solutions and competitors to get ideas on user experience.  If you don’t have mockups you can usability test competitors to start thinking ahead about your own user design.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6483,First Reasonable Option,"We usually don’t chose the best option, we chore the first reasonable option that we find on the site.  We do this because we are in a hurry, there is no penalty for guessing wrong, guessing is more fun.  We don’t take time to figure out how things work, we tinker and muddle through them."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6484,Usability Testing,Watching people try to use what you created while they talk about it out loud.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6485,Websites for Usability Testing,Usertesting.com
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6486,Flailing,Trying new things constantly and then abandoning them without further or proper study.  Flailing leads to wildly overcomplicated products with abandoned features used by a small percentage of users.  
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6487,Avoid Bias,"The worst thing you can do is tell the test subject what you are working on and how great it will be for them.  You are not there to talk you are there to listen.  This requires humility and putting your ego on the back burner.  The more you have to explain, the more you bias the experiment."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6488,Validation Trap,The ability to validate a hypothesis can be tricky and requires several different approaches.  
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6489,Minimal Effort,Testing does not have to always be statistically significant or 300 pages long.  Sometimes it is meeting with a couple people and sketching something on paper.  Your testing never needs to be seen outside of your office so fancy reports are useless.  Try to find the minimal possible effort to confidently prove or disprove your hypothesis.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6490,Test First,Test your product hypothesis before you build it.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6491,Narrow Market,Start with a narrow market (ex   urban moms who work FT and don’t have nannies).  Don’t worry if it isn’t very big because you can always expand.  
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6492,Books,"Rocket Surgery Made Easy, Don’t Make Me Think, Design of Everyday Things, UX for Lean Startups, Letting Go of the Words."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6493,Making Things Pretty Warning,Premature prettification can cause lots of user experience disasters.  Make it clean and clear but not pixel perfect until you’ve tested it.  Users are less likely to give you critical feedback when things are pretty.  Good visuals will distract people from functionality.  You will subconsciously make compromises to suit the visual design.  
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6494,Fun,"Make the experience fun and rewarding for the tester, facilitator, and the audience watching screen from another room.  Use humor, snacks, drinks, etc."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6495,Qualifying criteria for usability testers,"Make sure you qualify the testers.  Early on they don’t have to be part of your target market, although it is best to test your target customer.  Example of criteria, English speaking, has used a web browser, has used a spreadsheet, has used LinkedIn, FB.  "
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6496,Conflicts of Interest,"In any organization you have multiple interests working on a single product (example  developers, marketers, user experience, sales people, finance people, hr, etc.).  Each interest has their separate goals such as technical ease, aesthetics, actionable design, onboarding, ease of use, ets.  Many times people will disguise their personal opinions as facts in order to push their agenda and in turn will sacrifice the quality of the overall product."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6497,Get Out of The Building,"If you have questions about your product, message, feature, the answer is not in your office or in your CEO, your answer is outside of the building and only your customers can help you find it.  "
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6498,Clarity Trumps Consistency,"If you can make something significantly clearer by making it slightly inconsistent, choose in favor of clarity but make sure you have thoroughly exhausted every option for consistency.  "
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6499,Tweak Don’t Redesign,"Following agile principles, don’t create large reports from usability testing and keep the changes you make from testing as small tweaks and not large redesigns."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6500,Customer Profile,"Finalize the hypothesized customer profile. Brainstorm what factors most dramatically distinguish users from another {e.g., age, use, current solution, size, gender, type of sales, tech savviness, title, problem, inputs, outputs, education, target, B2B/B2C, Co Age, Co Size, Experience, Sales Cycle, LTV, etc)."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6501,Scheduling Usability Tests,Don’t schedule more than three to five people.  No labs or mirrors.  Better to test in person but you can test remotely.  Schedule once a month consistently.  Don’t schedule around release dates because those can constantly shift and be moved back.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6502,Number One Usability Rule,Don’t Make Them Think.  Things should be obvious and not require thought or interpretation.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6503,Usability,Design that a person of average or below average skill can use without it being more trouble than it is worth.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6504,MVP,Building the smallest possible thing you can in order to conclusively validate or invalidate your hypothesis.
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6505,Usability Problems,"Bad wording, ambiguity, multiple definitions, technical language, alignment, proximity, scale, etc."
Usability Notes,Usability Notes,,6506,Usability,A person of average or below average ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it is worth.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6555,Surveys,"Surveys are not good at getting in touch with your users because you will either have to ask closed ended questions that will bias the results or open ended questions that won’t get you to what you need to know.  To get a lot of information, use the telephone.  Surveys are not good at generating hypotheses but may be okay at validating hypotheses.  "
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6556,Big Three,Market - Group of people you think might want to buy your product.  Problem - Reason those people are going to use your product.  Product - Way to solve your users problems.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6557,Funnel Analytics,Funnel analysis involves using a series of events that lead towards a defined goal.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6558,Qualitative v. Quantitative,"Develop hypotheses with qualitative research, test hypotheses with quantitative research.  Use qualitative methods when you are testing multiple variables and want to generate hypotheses or improve the product.  Use quantitative methods when you are trying to validate a single variable and prove a hypothesis."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6559,Measurable Goal,You should always have a measurable goal before you start designing and all those goals should tie into your business goals.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6560,Questions to ask users,"What were you expecting from the product when you signed up, what do you feel the product offered, how was the product different from what you expected, how much time did you spend with the product, what was your reaction, where did you learn about the product, did you speak to anyone else about the product, if so who and what did you talk about.  Do this on the phone."

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6565,Visionary Products,"Use caution, something groundbreaking can be wildly unusable because nobody has ever seen anything like it before.  Requires extra usability testing, training, support, tutorials, simplicity in design, features you can turn off, etc."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6566,Mistakes in Analyzing Data,"Trying to get statistical significance when you don’t need it, tracking short term changes but ignoring the long term effects on other variables, forgetting the goals of the metrics, combining data from multiple tests.  "
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6567,Flailing,Trying new things constantly and then abandoning them without further or proper study.  Flailing leads to wildly overcomplicated products with abandoned features used by a small percentage of users.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6569,Validate Ideas,"The vast majority of startup ideas are based on things that somebody thought was cool or interesting, rather than something that really solves a problem for people.  Validate as early as possible.  The earlier you validate, the less likely you have to pivot."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6570,Ethnographic Studies,The best way to understand the problem of your users is to go out and observe them in person.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6577,Whiteboard Brainstorming,Start by clearly explaining the user problem and the reason you are choosing to solve it.  Explain how you will measure success.  If other people give other criteria for success take them into consideration but remember to prioritize otherwise you will have a bloated result.  Have everybody write down their ideas and then go around and have people read and clarify.  Categorize ideas.  Do it in 15 – 30 minutes.  Pick something and then test it.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6578,UsabilityHub,Site that helps you do testing.  Post a mockup of your landing page and ask those three questions from 10 to 15 test subjects.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6579,Usability Testing Feedback,"Shut the help up.  You are listening, not talking.  Don’t give a guided tour.  Let them explore on their own before you give them tasks.  Let them fail and flail.  Ask open ended questions.  Follow up if they give you generic answers (ex   you said that was cool, what was cool about it).  "
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6580,Prototype Testing,Show them something that looks like your product and ask for their reactions.  Never ask them if they think it is a good idea or would buy.  A lot of times they either don’t know if they would buy or they are going to say yes just to be nice.  The closer you can make it look to the real product the more accurately you can predict whether people will use that product.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6581,UX,Should be testing and validating new features before sending them on to development.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6582,Landing Page Tests,Sell the product before you build it.  You can get a ballpark of how many people are willing to pay you to solve their problem.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6587,Don’t need large samples,"Remember, for qualitative research you want to find the minimum number of people to interview until you discover the same patterns."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6588,Making Things Pretty Warning,Premature prettification can cause lots of user experience disasters.  Make it clean and clear but not pixel perfect until you’ve tested it.  Users are less likely to give you critical feedback when things are pretty.  Good visuals will distract people from functionality.  You will subconsciously make compromises to suit the visual design.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6589,Screen vs. Paper,People interact differently with screen than paper so show things on a computer unless you need to lay many things out side by side.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6591,Competitor Analysis Testing,"Observe customers using your competitors products and identify their pains and problems.  You can do this before you even have a product.  What workarounds have they created to avoid the pain.  Run Google, Facebook, or Craigslist ads to find five people using your competitors products.  Watch and ask questions.  "
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6592,Quantitative Research,"Measuring what real people are actually doing.  It doesn’t usually involve speaking with humans.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6595,Product-Problem Match,Just because a lot of people have a problem doesn’t mean that your product will solve their problem.  You must test this and ask “does this product really solve the identified problem.”
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6596,Stealing,It’s okay to steal design ideas but you first need to make sure they work for your customers.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6597,Invalidation,"Invalidating an idea is the same as validating it.  Once you invalidate, search out why your hypothesis was wrong and communicate that information to your team.  Every failed thing you don’t’ do will save you lots of time and money.  "
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6598,Pain Driven Design,"Instead of designing to your users, you design towards your users pains and problems.  Many users don’t really know what they want or don’t know the best solution to solve your problems so this approach is possibly more effective."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6599,Get Out of The Building,"If you have questions about your product, message, feature, the answer is not in your office or in your CEO, your answer is outside of the building and only your customers can help you find it.  "

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6601,A/B Testing,"Good for getting statistically significant data that you can hang your hat on, proving hypothesis, understand what customers are actually doing, make decisions on what to cut and what to improve, validate design decision and hypotheses, see which small changes have big impact on metrics.  Not good if you are constantly making many changes on your product, message, etc.  In other words not great for early testing unless you are isolating your changes and can test them individually."
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6602,Opt-In,Give users the option of opting in to new features or design changes so you don’t make them upset.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6603,Unmoderated Testing,"Getting a video of a real world human using your product.  Good for finding if your product is easy to use by someone who has never seen it.  Bad for finding if people will like, use, buy your product and finding out how to fix usability problems.

User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6614,Feature Stub (Fake Door),Add a button that says upgrade or buy to test whether users will pay additional for a certain feature or version of your software.  
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6615,Testing,A product is a set of hypotheses to be validated or invalidated.  The quicker you can do so the faster you will have a good product and the less money you will spend.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6616,MVP,A minimum viable product is minimal and viable.  The product should not be useless but should just have them minimal number of working features and then continues to add features based on customer and pain driven design processes.  A landing page can be a MVP.
User Testing & Research,User Testing & Research,,6617,Study Similar People,"   As mentioned earlier, find a specific market of people and test them to uncover patterns in their behavior.  It is better to study similar people than a bunch of random people because you will better be able to identify pattern overlap.  Ask them to show you how they currently perform some of the tasks your problem is trying to solve."
